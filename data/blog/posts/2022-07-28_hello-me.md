You are probably expecting some very deep and inspiring thoughts written down by my nerdy fingers tapping away on an expensive mechanical keyboard while my self is in a dark room staring at a screen with green text on black (let's not forget the black hoodie), but there's sadly nothing of that!

You've been <span class="text-red">scammed</span>!

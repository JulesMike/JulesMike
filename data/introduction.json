  "introduction": "<h3 style=\"margin-top: 0\">Michaël Giovanni Jules</h3>\n\nI build micro things that communicate together.\n\nI have 10+ years of software development experience and have fallen in love with cloud-native application development and all the exciting opportunities and challenges it brings. Through the years I have been fortunate to have worked on several Go projects ranging from small to large, monoliths and microservices.\n\nI 😍 working in Go and Elixir but as you can already tell, I like Front-end techs too 😏.",

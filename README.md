    Hello world! I love programming!

    Ever since writing my first line of code in DarkBASIC in 2005, I have been hooked and never looked back.
    Throughout high school and college, I jumped on projects that would help me learn and grow as a developer.
    Eventually, over the years, this passion has led me to work with a wide range of programming languages,
    frameworks, teams and products.

    Since 2015, I have been working with Go and I can proudly say I'm a Gopher at heart.
    I was fortunate to work on several Go projects from small to large, monoliths and microservices.

    I enjoy talking about Go and the future of emerging tech, so don't hesitate to reach out.
